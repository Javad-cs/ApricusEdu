**ApricusEdu** (from *apricus*, Latin for “full of sunlight”) is a free educational platform that makes learning more accessible, intuitive, and joyful. Our goal is to help struggling students understand school concepts deeply — not just memorize, but truly *get it*.

---

##  Features

-  Explore homepage, team, FAQ, and feedback without registration
-  Sample educational videos for each grade and subject
-  Signup/login with form validation and error messages
-  Smooth page transitions using Flask routing and JavaScript
-  Auto-rotating and manually controllable feedback section
-  SQL database for registered users
-  Azerbaijani-language math content (grades 6–11)

---

##  How It Works

- Users land on a homepage with our mission in two lines.
- They can explore public pages: **Courses**, **Team**, **FAQ**, and **Feedbacks**.
- Clicking on **Courses** opens a dropdown of subjects → users choose one and see sample videos by grade.
- Logging in unlocks access to more personalized course pages with full lecture access.
- Our login/signup forms include real-time validation and helpful error messages, built with Flask.
- The feedback carousel uses Bootstrap for clean transitions and manual control arrows.
- Footer includes links for future social media and contact email.

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
- **Sessions:** Flask-Session
