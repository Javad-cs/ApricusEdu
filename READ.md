#### Description:
My project is called ApricusEdu where latin word Apricus has a lovely meaning of "full of sunlight" and edu is short version of "education". The main goals of the webiste was to make education more accesible, help struggling students with school curriculmn, and awaken the feeling of young people to learn and explore. When opening the webiste the first thing one see is homepage. With 2 short sentences we introduce them what's our goal. They can explore the team, feedbacks, and faq without registration. They can also get sense of how the education videos will be like. To do so, they just need to click on courses button on navigation bar, select the desired subject from newly poped out course bar which will lead users to course page where one can check out sample video about selected subject for each grade. 

When clicked on log in or sign up buttons, short forms are appearing. Our website require password of at least length of 8. When filling something incorrect, or leaving empty and clicking on log in/sign up button, error message appears while keeping inputed text by user intact. We did it using flask. 

When logged in, on homepage the "explore" button appears. Clicking on it smoothly transit you to page on the bottom, where we gave a bit of more information on the purpose of our website. 

When clicked on team, photo of me and my brother appears with the text besides them about us and our role in making webiste. 

When it comes to feedbacks page, we struggled a bit. It was hard to implement the idea about switching the content. We tried doing it with css animation and Java Script. But, at the end decided that, implementing it with bootstrap would be easier, better, and more convenient. On the feedbacks page, you can see feedback of different individuals automotically switching. When cliking on arrows, you can manually switch feedbacks as well.

After logging in, you get more diverse videos. By cliking on courses button on navigation bar, you can select the course you want to take, and it will lead to smallest grade about which we offer lectures. By cliking on the grade you desire, on left bar, you can select the grade about which you want to hear lectures about. By cliking to the video frame and inside of it, you can access to the video.

At the bottom, there is also a footer where our project's future email, and social media links. 

Almost all page switching was done using flask. The rest was css and html. We also used Java Script to show and hide passwords and sql to make data base for signed up users.
